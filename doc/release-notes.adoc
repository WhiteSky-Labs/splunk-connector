=== Migrating from Older Versions

If youâ€™re currently using the Splunk Connector 1.0.0 to migrate to this connector you need to:

- Upgrade to at least Mule Runtime 3.5.3
- Install the new connector from Exchange

=== Features

- No new features

=== Fixed in this Release

- Splunk SDK 1.3.0 did not support JDK 1.8 out-of-the-box, due to a change in SSL cipher handling. New release switches to TLS1.2 instead of SSLv3 as recommended by Splunk.
- testConnection was not correctly detecting expired tokens, so connections would error after the token expiry time.

=== Known Issues

- User Management APIs are not currently supported
- Realtime searches never terminate, so will run until the connector is terminated.

=== Support Resources
- Splunk SDK for Java v 1.5.0 - http://dev.splunk.com/view/java-sdk/SP-CAAAECN
